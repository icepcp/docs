# Introduction
## What is IGL?
IGL (a.k.a. I'm Gonna Lie) is an alternative to the popular NGL (a.k.a. Not Gonna Lie) site. It features a simple and clean interface, similar to the one found on NGL.
## What is NGL?
NGL is a popular site where users can send anonymous messages to the recipient, with it's main purpose being a place where users can share their thoughts and feelings.
## How does NGL work?
Once a user signs up on NGL, they have a link that they can share with others. This link can be used to send messages anonymously to the user. IGL works similarly to NGL, however, you have to deploy it yourself.
## Why is IGL better than NGL?
* IGL is open source, meaning that you can see the code and make changes to it.
* IGL has no tracking code at all, unlike NGL, which links you to a UUID, and can be used to track you.
* IGL can be customised to your liking. You can change the colours, the fonts, the layout, and more.
## Why is NGL better than IGL?
* NGL is more popular than IGL, it is also easier to sign up.
* NGL has a 'dice' feature, which gives you a random message from a list of messages.
* NGL has an app, which allows for notifications whenever you receive a message. 
  * IGL can have a similar notification feature using Supabase Webhooks.
