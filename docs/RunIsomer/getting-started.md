# Getting Started
This section will help you clone the RunIsomer repository and have your very own Isomer page.

Isomer uses Netlify to deploy the website, so we will be using that too. (If you know how to make Isomer run on Github Pages, [fork and open a pull request](https://github.com/icepcp/RunIsomer).) Clicking on the Deploy to Netlify button will clone my repo and give you an Isomer website with a Netlify domain.
