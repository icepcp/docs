# Introduction
Theming Isomer is pretty simple. Since the site is based on Markdown and YAML (and a bit of Jekyll? not sure), it allows for content to be done exclusively on markdown files and themes in YAML, keeping the design consistent. Take a look on the sidebar to see what can be configured, so that your Isomer site looks just how you want it to be :D

If there's something missing, feel free to create a PR on my documentation repo (Github logo on top right) to add it.
