:::warning
This documentation has been put off as I am unable to properly configure Isomer. It turns out it might be an issue on my side, as I forked a working copy of Isomer from GitHub and tried to deploy it to both Netlify and Cloudflare Pages, to no avail. I will try to fix this issue and update this documentation.

# What is Isomer?
From [isomer.gov.sg](https://www.isomer.gov.sg/faq/), Isomer is an informational website builder created by the Open Government Products team at Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech). It provides template for website with hosting and is compliant to applicable clauses in the Instruction Manual 8 (IM8), Design Service Standard (DSS) and Usability Checklist (UC).
# Why Isomer?
Instead of the traditional HTML, Isomer uses Markdown, Jekyll and YAML. This makes it simpler to edit, easier to design for all screen resolutions, and allows for easy content formatting.
# Who uses Isomer?
Agencies from Singapore use Isomer along with IsomerCMS, however we cannot access the CMS as it is hosted on GovTech's servers, and even if we could access it, we can't add our website in it.
# Is there a demo?
Yes! Check out isomer.icepcp.com to take a look at how an Isomer site looks like.

Check out the [RunIsomer](https://github.com/icepcp/RunIsomer) repository as that is what my documentation will cover
